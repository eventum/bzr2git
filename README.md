Originally created by [Petter Sandholdt](https://gist.github.com/4159212), improved by [Elan Ruusam√§e](https://gist.github.com/4566142)
which now landed [here](https://github.com/eventum/bzr2git).

This is two way synchronization from [Eventum Bazaar repository](https://launchpad.net/eventum/trunk) (trunk) to [Eventum Git repository](https://github.com/eventum/eventum) (master).
